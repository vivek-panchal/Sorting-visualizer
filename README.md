# Sorting Visualizer

This is a [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps) built using React and is used to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, etc.


## Purpose

I wanted to improve my skills with React and also learn classic sorting algorithms. This project turned out to be a great way to achieve both of the aforementioned objectives at the same time.
